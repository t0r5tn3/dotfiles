I am German and I'm usually using a German keyboard layout.

Some default keyboard shortcuts are not or hardly available with a German keyboard layout.
These keys are differently mapped on my system ...

The mousemap file just adds some convenient jump features I'm frequently using.

Just move or copy any of these file to the appropiate location ;-)
